      This is a fact table that lists and stores information about orders at the order item level of granularity. 
      The table includes foreign keys to be used for joining with dimension tables, date columns (such as order date), 
      metrics (such as freight per item, gross revenue, and net revenue), and descriptive columns such as delivery vendor
